Cautions,22
"1. Due to variation in research methodology and/or date of content, tree cover, loss and gain cannot be compared against each other. Accordingly, “net” loss cannot be calculated by subtracting tree cover gain from tree cover loss, and current (or post-2000) tree cover extent cannot be determined by subtracting annual tree cover loss from year 2000 tree cover extent. 
2. Please also note that “tree cover” does not equate to common definitions of “forest.” “Tree cover” refers to the biophysical presence of trees, which may be a part of natural forests or tree plantations. Thus, loss of tree cover may occur for many reasons, including deforestation, fire, and logging within the course of sustainable forestry operations. Similarly, tree cover gain may indicate the growth of trees within natural or managed forests.
